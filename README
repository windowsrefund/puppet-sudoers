Puppet Sudoers Module
=====================

Manage sudo entries in appropriate sudoers file and ensure that the sudo
package is installed on the system.

I am tired of managing my sudoers content via the file type and figure it would
be nice to do things such as:

sudoers::user { carla:
  ensure => present,
  nopasswd => true,
  commands => "ALL",
}

and for a group:

sudoers::group { wheel:
  ensure => present,
  nopasswd => true,
  commands => "ALL",
}

In order to ensure os-specific resources are satifisied, the following
definitions have been provided:

sudoers::user
sudoers::group

Each definition makes use of the sudoers type.
